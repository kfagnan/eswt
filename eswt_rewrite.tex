\begin{abstract}
Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) is a noninvasive treatment
used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal ailments.
A shock wave is generated in water
and then focused using an acoustic lens or reflector so the energy of
the wave is concentrated in a small treatment region where mechanical stimulation
enhancing healing.
In this work we have computationally
investigated shock wave propagation in ESWT by solving a Lagrangian
form of the isentropic Euler equations in the fluid and linear
elasticity in the bone using high-resolution finite volume methods.
We solve a full three-dimensional system of equations and use adaptive mesh
refinement to concentrate grid cells near the propagating shock.  
We can model complex bone
geometries, the reflection and mode conversion at interfaces, and the
the propagation of the resulting
shear stresses generated within the bone.   We discuss the validity of our
simplified model and present results validating this approach.

\section{Model equations}
\label{sec:model_equations}
Much of the previous work on ESWT has been centered around the use of the Euler equations with the 
Tait or Tamman equations of state.  These equations of state are typically used for modeling underwater 
explosions like the spark plug source of the lithotripter device \cite{hamilton,toro_ivings}.  In this section 
we discuss the full Euler equations and proceed to show why the Tait equation of state is sufficient for 
modeling ESWT.  Since this equation of state is only a function of the density, $\rho$, we show how it 
can be modeled within the framework of linearized elasticity, which enables us to model both the fluid 
and solid with a single system of equations. 

In two space dimensions the Euler equations take the form
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t} q + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(q) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} g(q) = 0,
	\label{eqn:euler2D}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
	q = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho \\ \rho u \\ \rho v \\ E \end{array} \right  ], ~~~ 
	f(q) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho u \\ \rho u^2 + p \\ \rho uv \\ u(E+p) \end{array} \right],~~~
	g(q) =  \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho v \\ \rho uv \\ \rho u^2 + p \\ v(E+p) \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}
Here $u$ and $v$ denote the velocities in the $x$ and $y$ direction, respectively.  The total energy is $E 
= \rho e + \frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$, and the total enthalpy is $H = h + \frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$.

Several of the problems we investigated are axially symmetric and this enabled us to reduce the three-
dimensional equations to a two-dimensional form.  If we first rewrite the equations in cylindrical 
coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ and then assume no variation and zero velocity in the $\theta$ direction, the 
system we obtain is reduced to two variables, $r$ and $z$.  
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho \\ \rho u_r \\ \rho u_v \\ E \end{array} \right] +
	\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho u_r \\ \rho u_r^2 + p \\ \rho u_r w_z \\ u_r(E+p) 
\end{array} \right] + 
	\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho w_z \\ \rho u_r w_z\\ \rho w_z^2 + p \\ w_z(E+p) 
\end{array} \right ] = 
	\left[ \begin{array}{c} -(\rho u_r)/r \\ -(\rho u_r^2)/r \\ -(\rho u_r v_z) \\ u_r(E+p)/r \end{array} \right ],  
	\label{eqn:2daxisymeuler}
\end{equation}
where $u_r$ and $w_z$ denote the velocities in the $r$ and $z$ directions, respectively.  These 
equations are of the same form as (\ref{eqn:euler2D}), with the addition of geometric source terms that 
are a result of the variable transformation.

\subsection{Equation of State}
\label{sec:eos_discussion}
In order to solve the system (\ref{eqn:euler2D}) or (\ref{eqn:2daxisymeuler}), we need to close the 
system with a relation between the pressure and conserved variables.  We have used the Tait 
\cite{thompson} and Tammann \cite{ivings_toro} equations of state, which are applicable to a wide range 
of liquids.  It has been common practice to use the Tait EOS in shock wave therapy and lithotripsy 
models \cite{saito,nakahara_hugoniot}.  This may seem surprising considering the treatment relies upon 
shock waves to deliver energy and mechanical forces, which typically require a non-isentropic EOS.  
The Tammann equation of state is valid for non-isentropic flow and experiments have shown that two 
equations of state agree in the isentropic flow regime \cite{thompson}.  In the event that the shock is 
weak, or there is only a very small change in the entropy, an equation of state that only depends on the 
density, such as the Tait equation of state, can be used.  Several studies have indicated that in ESWT, 
there is no significant change in density or pressure as a result of the change of entropy across the 
shock \cite{nakahara} for pressures ranging from $1-200$ MPa.  This indicates that the use of the Tait 
equation of state should be sufficient for the study of ESWT.

The Tait equation of state is
\begin{equation}
	p = p(\rho) = B\left[ \left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^n - 1\right], 
	\label{eqn:taiteos}
\end{equation}
where B is a pressure constant that is a weak function of entropy, but is typically treated as a constant, 
$n$ is a constant playing a similar role to that of $\gamma$ in the ideal gas law, $\rho$ is the density, 
and $p$ the pressure.

The Tammann equation of state can be written as
\begin{equation}
	p = p(\rho, e) = (\gamma - 1)\rho e - \gamma p_{\infty},
	\label{eqn:tammaneos}
\end{equation}
where $p$,$\rho$ and $e$ are the pressure, density and specific internal energy, respectively.  The 
values in water for the pressure constant, $p_c$, and polytropic constant, $\gamma$, are the same as 
$B$ and $n$ in the Tait equation of state.  This equation is similar to the ideal gas law, and reduces to 
the ideal gas law in the case where $p_{\infty} = 0$ and $ 1 < \gamma < 2$.

If it is possible to use the Tait EOS in our model, the equations (\ref{eqn:1dlageulfixgrid}) can be further 
simplified, reducing the computational complexity of our simulations.  Therefore, we performed a 
numerical investigation of the propagation of a shock wave when modeled by both the Tammann and 
Tait equation of state.  Figure \ref{fig:tait_tamman} a) shows the result from one experiment where a 
shock wave with peak over pressure of $\approx 180$ MPa has propagated through water.  The blue 
wave represents the result from solving with the Tammann equation of state and the red represents the 
solution with the Tait equation of state, the pressure profiles are nearly identical.  This gives us 
confidence that the calculations we are interested in can be done by solving the Euler equations with the 
Tait equation of state, and we can therefore neglect the equation for energy
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho \\ \rho u \\ \rho v \end{array} \right] +
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho u_r \\ \rho u^2 + p \\ \rho u v \end{array} \right] + 
	\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \rho w_z \\ \rho u v\\ \rho v^2 + p \end{array} \right ] = 
	\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\0  \end{array}\right ]. 
	\label{eqn:isentropic}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Elasticity equations}
\label{sec:elasticity}
In the case of infinitesimal or small displacements, it is possible to write the elasticity equations as 
\begin{align}
 \epsilon_t - u_x &= 0 \label{eqn:nlelast}\\
 \rho_0 u_t - \sigma(\epsilon)_x &= 0  \notag\\
\end{align}
where the higher order terms in the deformation tensor have been neglected.  This form of the equations 
still allows for nonlinear behavior to be incorporated through the stress-strain relationship, $
\sigma(\epsilon)$.  We take advantage of this formulation in order to incorporate the nonlinear Tait 
equation of state in the fluid. 

In the case of a fluid where the shear modulus is zero, the stress tensor can be written as $
\sigma(\epsilon) = -pI$, where $p$ is the pressure in the fluid and $I$ is the identity matrix.  In the case of 
ESWT, the pressure only depends on changes in the density, and we can rewrite $p(\rho)$ as a function 
of the strain tensor $\epsilon$.  In the case of small deformations, we have that 
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\rho_0}{\det(F)} = \frac{\rho_0}{1+tr(\epsilon)},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the deformation gradient tensor.

If we plug this into the Tait equation of state (\ref{eqn:taiteos}) we get
\begin{equation}
p(\rho) = p(\epsilon) = B\left[ \left(\frac{1}{1 + tr(\epsilon)}\right)^n - 1\right].  
\end{equation} 
Therefore, in the fluid, we get the following for our stress-strain relationship 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\epsilon) = -(B\left[ \left(\frac{1}{1 + tr(\epsilon)}\right)^n - 1\right]) I
\end{equation} 

This is only valid in the case where the displacements are small, so we calculated the maximum value of 
the displacements in a two-dimensional axisymmetric calculation with the Euler equations.  We found 
that for the maximum peak pressure of 50MPa, the corresponding maximum velocity was (look up 
numerical values from the calculation) $10^{-3}$m/s.  We then calculated the maximum displacement by 
integrating the velocity over the time step of the calculation and found this to be on the order of 
$10^{-5}$mm.  It is therefore reasonable to assume that the density in each grid cell is essentially 
constant, $\rho = \rho_0$ and that the Lagrangian framework of the elasticity equations will be valid for 
the fluid.  To test this, we took the same initial condition for the 2D axisymmetric Euler equations with the 
Tamman equation of state and the corresponding 2D axisymmetric Lagrangian form of the equations 
with the Tait equation of state and measured the pressure at the focus, F2.  The results in Figure 
\ref{fig:tait_tamman} b) demonstrate reasonably good agreement between the two cases, but the 
Lagrangian form is slightly attenuated.  This may be due to conversion of the initial condition from the 
conserved variables in the Euler equations (\ref{eqn:2daxisymeuler}) to those in the elasticity equations 
(\ref{eqn:elastiic}).

Since the displacements are so small, it may be reasonable to use a linearized version of the Tait 
equation of state in our calculations, so then we would be able to simply use the linear elasticity 
equations.  If we assume a small perturbation to the strain, $\epsilon + \delta \epsilon$, we can write the 
(\ref{eqn:taiteos}) as
\begin{equation}
	p(\epsilon) = p_0 + p'(\delta \epsilon) \epsilon + \frac{p''(\delta \epsilon)}{2} \epsilon^2 + 
\text{ H.O.T. }
	\label{eqn:tait_taylor}
\end{equation}
What we call the linear Tait EOS is just the first two terms of (\ref{eqn:tait_taylor}) and the quadratic Tait 
EOS is the first three terms.  We found that for smaller amplitude waves, the linear Tait EOS is insufficient 
for predicting the correct arrival time or amplitude.  If we include the quadratic term, then we can 
accurately determine the arrival time, but the amplitude is still incorrect.  As we increase the amplitude of 
the pressure wave, i.e. there is a larger jump in pressure across the shock, neither the linear nor 
quadratic EOS can capture the correct arrival time or amplitude.  This is demonstrated in Figure
\ref{fig:tait_linearization}.

\caption{I will make these look better later if we decide to include them.  I'm trying to think of a better 
plot... maybe error vs. amplitude or something like that to just summarize the results}
\end{figure}

For the linear isotropic solid, we use Hooke's law
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{11} &= C_{11} \epsilon^{11} + C_{12} \epsilon^{22} + C_{13} \epsilon_{33} \\
\sigma^{22} &= C_{21} \epsilon^{11} + C_{22} \epsilon^{22} + C_{23} \epsilon^{33}  \\
\sigma^{33} &=C_{31} \epsilon^{11} + C_{32} \epsilon^{22} + C_{33} \epsilon^{33}  \\
\sigma^{12} &= C_{44} \epsilon^{12} \\
\sigma^{13} &= C_{55} \epsilon^{13}\\
\sigma^{23} &=  C_{66} \epsilon^{23}. \\
\end{align*}
where the scalar coefficients $C_{ij}$ are determined by the properties of the material being modeled.  
The parameters used for the bone model were found in \cite{burr}.

With these two stress-strain relations and the methodology discussed in \Sec{numerics}, we are able to 
model ESWT with one system of equations.

%\subsection{Comparison of Lagrangian and Eulerian Solution}
%\label{sec:lag_eul_comp}
%Given the result in Figure \ref{fig:tait_tammann} a), combined with the small displacements in our 
model, we are confident that the two systems of equations should agree for the weak shocks present in 
ESWT.  We performed an axisymmetric calculation with the Euler equations using the Tammann 
equation of state to generate an initial condition for the experiment.  We then measured the focused 
wave form at $x=115.0$ for both the Eulerian and Lagrangian form of the equations.  In Figure 
\ref{fig:tait_tammann} b) we see that the two models give nearly the same solution, however, the wave 
from the Lagrangian calculation has been slightly attenuated.


\section{Numerical Methodology}
\label{sec:numerics}
We used the wave-propagation algorithms described in \cite{rjl_book} and implemented in CLAWPACK 
\cite{clawpack} to solve the system \ref{sys:nlelast}.  In this section we provide the basic details of the 
numerical methodology and approximate solution to the Riemann problem with a spatially-varying flux 
function, similar to what was done in \cite{rjl_nonlinear}  We also discuss computational issues that 
necessitate the use of Adaptive Mesh Refinement. 

\subsection{Approximate Riemann Solver}
\label{sec:riemann_solver}
In order to apply the high-resolution wave propagation algorithms described in 
\cite{rjl_book,rjl_nolnlinear} to equations (\ref{sys:nlelast}), we must first determine the solution to the 
Riemann problem.  Recall that the Riemann problem is the initial value problem for a hyperbolic system 
of conservation laws, 
$$
	q_t + f(q)_x = 0, 
$$
with special initial data consisting of two constant states separated by a discontinuity
$$
	    q_{0}(x) = \begin{choice} q_l &\text{if}~x<0 \\
                    q_r &\text{if}~x>0 \end{choice}.
$$
For nonlinear systems of equations, such as (\ref{eqn:nlelast}) this is often most efficiently done through 
the use of an approximate Riemann solver \cite{rjl_book}.  

The approximate Riemann solver is developed using an approach that has been successfully applied to 
conservation laws of the form
\begin{equation}
q_t + f(q,x)_x =0,
\end{equation}
where $f(q,x)$ is a spatially-varying flux function.  The flux function is how we incorporate different 
equations of state, or stress-strain relations, to model the different materials.  The Riemann problem 
between computational grid cells $i-1$ and $i$ is based on two flux functions $f_{i-1}(q)$ and $f_i(q)$, 
as well as the data $Q_{i-1}$ and $Q_i$.  In the case considered below, there are always at least two so-
called P-waves in the Riemann solution.  One wave $\mathcal{W}^1$ propagating to the left with speed 
$s^1=-c_p < 0$ and $\mathcal{W}^2$ propagating to the right with speed $s^2 = c_p > 0$.  In the solid 
there may be four additional shear or S-waves propagating at speeds $\pm c_s$.  If the shear modulus 
is zero, there will be 7 zero-speed stationary waves, otherwise there will only be 3.  These waves are 
taken to be of the form $\mathcal{W}^j = \alpha^j r^j$ for $j=1\dots9$.  In our case, the vectors $r^j$ are 
taken to be the eigenvectors of a linearized problem $f^{\prime}(q,x)$ and $\alpha^j$ are scalar 
coefficients.  The $\alpha^j$ are typically determined by solving $Q_i - Q_{i-1} = R {\bf \alpha}$, where R 
is the matrix of eigenvectors $r^j$. However, since we have a spatially-varying flux function, we 
determine these scalars by solving $f_i(Q_i) - f_{i-1}(Q_{i-1}) = R {\bf \beta}$.  Then, using $\beta^j$ we 
get $\alpha^j = \beta^j/s^j$.  The full details of the so-called {\it f-wave decomposition} can be found in 
\cite{rjl_bale_rossmanith}.

In general, the solution to the Riemann problem will have the structure detailed in Figure 
\ref{fig:riemann_tait_elas}.  This particular case shows the solution where two neighboring grid cells 
have different stress-strain relationships.

\subsection{Solution of the Riemann Problem for 3D Nonlinear Elasticity}
\label{sec:3Delasticity}
The full three-dimensional system of equations for the Isentropic Euler equations in Lagrangian 
coordinates is 
\begin{align}
(\epsilon_{11})_t &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{22})_t &= \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{33})_t &= \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{12})_t &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)\notag\\
(\epsilon_{23})_t &= \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}\right)\label{eqn:
3dlgeulsys}\\
(\epsilon_{13})_t &= \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)\notag\\
\rho u_t &= \frac{\partial \sigma_{11}}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial \sigma_{12}}{\partial y} +  \frac{\partial 
\sigma_{13}}{\partial z}\notag\\
\rho v_t &=   \frac{\partial \sigma_{12}}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial \sigma_{22}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial 
\sigma_{23}}{\partial z}\notag \\
\rho w_t &=  \frac{\partial \sigma_{13}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{23}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial 
\sigma_{33}}{\partial z}.\notag
\end{align}
We can write this system in the form 
\begin{equation}
	q_t - A(x,y,z) q_x + B(x,y,z) q_y + C(x,y,z) q_z = 0, 
\end{equation}
where $A$,$B$ and $C$ are the Jacobians of the flux functions in the $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions 
respectively.  For the multi-dimensional methods implemented in CLAWPACK, we need the solution to 
the Riemann problem along slices in each coordinate direction.  Here we provide the details for the 
solution in the $x$-direction, but the solution in the $y$ and $z$ directions are similar with appropriate 
perturbations to the $B$ and $C$ matrices. 

The corresponding Jacobian for this system in the $x$-direction is
\begin{equation}
A(q) = f^{\prime}(q) = -\left(\begin{array}{ccccccccc}0&0&0&0&0&0&\frac{1}{\rho}&0&0\\ 
0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0&0&0&\frac{1}{2\rho}&0\
\0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&\frac{1}{2\rho}\\ \sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}} & 
\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{22}} &\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{33}} & 0 &0 &0 &0&0&0\\0&0&0&
\sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}&0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0&\sigma^{13}_{\epsilon^{13}}&0&0&0 \end{array} 
\right)
\label{eqn:jac3dlgeul}
\end{equation}
The Jacobians in the $y$- and $z$- directions are similar with the entries perturbed appropriately. 

We have made use of the fact that the derivative of $\sigma^{11}$ with respect to the shear strain will be 
zero in either the Euler or elastic equations.  Similarly, the derivative of $\sigma^{12}$ or $\sigma^{13}$ 
will be non-zero only when taken with respect to the shear strains $\epsilon_{12}$ and $\epsilon^{13}$, 
respectively.

The eigenvalues for system (\ref{eqn:jac3dlgeul}) are
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{1,2} = \left (\pm \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}}}{\rho_0}}\right); ~~\lambda^{3,4} = \pm 
\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}}{2\rho_0}}; ~~\lambda^{5,6} = \pm 
\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{13}_{\epsilon^{13}}}{2\rho_0}}; ~~\lambda^{7,8,9}=0.
\label{eqn:3dlgeuleval}
\end{equation}

The corresponding eigenvectors for system (\ref{eqn:jac3dlgeul}) are
\begin{equation}
\left ( \begin{array}{c} 1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\ \pm\sqrt{\rho_0 \sigma^{11}_{\epsilon_{11}}}\\ 0\\0
\end{array}
\right ),
\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0\\0\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0\\\pm \sqrt{2 \rho_0 \sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}}\\0
\end{array}
\right),
\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\1\\0\\0\\ \pm\sqrt{2 \rho_0 \sigma^{13}_{\epsilon_{13}}}
\end{array}
\right ),
\left ( \begin{array}{c}-\frac{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{22}}}{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}}}\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0
\end{array}
\right ),
\left ( \begin{array}{c}-\frac{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{33}}}{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}}}\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0
\end{array}
\right ),
\left ( \begin{array}{c}0\\0\\0\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0
\end{array}
\right ).
\label{eqn:3dlgeulevec}
\end{equation}


The weights that we need to determine the wave strengths in the wave propagation algorithm found by 
solving $R \beta = f(Q_r) - f(Q_l)$ are found by solving
\begin{equation}
 \left ( \begin{array}{ccccccccc} 
 1& 0&0&1& 1&0&0&0& 1\\ 
 0&0 &0& -\frac{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}}}{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{22}}}& 0& 0&0&0&0 \\ 
 0&0 &0&0& -\frac{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{11}}}{\sigma^{11}_{\epsilon^{33}}}&0&0&0&0 \\

\rho_0}\\ 
 0& -\sqrt{2\rho_0 \sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}} &0&0& 0& 0& 0 & \sqrt{2 \rho_0 
\sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}} &0 \\ 
 0& 0&-\sqrt{2\rho_0 \sigma^{13}_{\epsilon^{13}}} &0& 0& 0& \sqrt{2 \rho_0\sigma^{13}_{\epsilon^{13}}} 
&0 &0 \end{array}
\right )  \left ( \begin{array}{c} \beta^1\\ \beta^2 \\ \beta^3 \\ \beta^4\\ \beta^5\\ \beta^6 \\ \beta^7 \\ \beta^8 \\ 
\beta^9
\end{array}
\right ) = \left ( \begin{array}{c} f^1\\ f^2 \\ f^3 \\ f^4\\ f^5 \\f^6 \\f^7\\f^8\\f^9
\end{array}
\right ). 
\label{eqn:2dlgeulfwave}
\end{equation}

The solution of the Riemann problem shows that we should expect 9 waves.  We will get two P-waves 
that travel at the speed $\pm c_p$, four S-waves with speeds $\pm c_s$ and 3 stationary waves.  In the 
case of a fluid, there are no S-waves, so we get seven stationary waves.  For the wave-propagation 
algorithms implemented in CLAWPACK, we only use the waves with non-zero speeds for the updates.

\subsection{Transverse solvers}
The method described here is based on propagating waves normal to each interface.  In reality, the 
waves will propagate in a multidimensional manner and affect cell averages in cells above and below 
those that are directly adjacent to the interface.  In order to include these transverse effects, each 
fluctuation is split into two transverse fluctuations.  This transverse decomposition of the fluctuations can 
be viewed as solving a second Riemann problem in the transverse direction, even though it is not based 
on left and right states as we normally think of for a Riemann solver.  Once we have determined the 
transverse fluctuations, they can be used to update the fluxes obtained by solving the original Riemann 
problem.  The transverse correction terms also have the effect of improving the stability limit, allowing for 
a Courant number of 1, relative to the maximum wave speed in any direction. 

(Could you suggest the level of detail that should be provided here?)

\subsection{Wave speeds}
\label{sec:wavespeeds}
Since we have rewritten the equations in a Lagrangian frame, we checked to be sure that the new sound 
speeds, or eigenvalues for our Jacobian, are correct.  In the case of the Euler equations with the Tait 
equation of state, $p(\rho) = p(\epsilon) = B[(\frac{1}{(1+\epsilon^{11} + \epsilon^{22} + 
\epsilon^{33})}^{n} - 1]$, we get the following
\begin{align}
     \sigma_{\epsilon^{11}} &= B n \left( \frac{1}{(1+\epsilon^{11} + \epsilon^{22} + \epsilon^{33})} 
\right )^{n +1} \notag\\
     			&= B n \frac{1}{(1+\epsilon^{11} + \epsilon^{22} + \epsilon^{33})} \left( \frac{1}{(1+
\epsilon^{11} + \epsilon^{22} + \epsilon^{33})} \right )^{n} \label{eqn:sigepstait}\\
			&=  \frac{1}{(1+\epsilon^{11} + \epsilon^{22} + \epsilon^{33})} n (p + B).\notag
\end{align}
If we then substitute $\rho(t) \approx \rho_0$ into our formula for the eigenvalues (\ref{eqn:sigepstait}), 
we get the following for our wave speeds 
\begin{equation}
	\pm \sqrt{\frac{n (p+B)}{\rho_0}}.
\label{eqn:lagisenspeed}
\end{equation}
In the standard form of the isentropic Euler equations, we would expect eigenvalues of the form 
\begin{equation}
	\lambda^{1,2} = u \pm c_p,
\end{equation}
for the acoustic wave speeds, where $u$ is the velocity of the fluid particles and $c_p$ is the speed of 
sound in the fluid.  As demonstrated in Section \Sec{??}, the velocities of the fluid particles are small, 
with a maximum value on the order of $10^{-3}$m/s directly behind the shock.  As a result, we can 
neglect the particle velocity in our computation without much of an error and then the wave speeds 
above agree with those from the isentropic Euler equations. Since fluids do not support shear stress the 
s-wave speed is zero.


For elasticity if we assume that the density $\rho$ is constant throughout a specific material, but can still 
vary spatially, and denote it $\rho_0$, then the eigenvalues are\\
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{1,2} = \left[\pm \sqrt{-\frac{\sigma_{\epsilon^{11}}}{\rho_0}}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\epsilon^{11}} = (\lambda+2\mu)$.  This means that we have
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{1,2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\lambda+2 \mu}{\rho_0}},
\end{equation}
which are the correct sound speed for the p-waves in a linearly elastic medium.  For the s-waves we get
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{3,4} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{12}_{\epsilon^{12}}}{2\rho_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho_0}},
\end{equation}
which is the correct speed for the s-waves in the $x-y$ direction.  The case works out similarly for the $x-
z$ direction.

%\subsection{Spatially-varying $\sigma(\epsilon)$}
%\label{sec:spatially_varying}
\subsection{Axisymmetric form of the equations}
\label{sec:axisym}
We used the two-dimensional axisymmetric form of the equations to generate and initial condition for our 
three-dimensional calculations, as well as for validation of our model.  

The three-dimensional equations in cylindrical coordinates are
\begin{align}
(\epsilon_{rr})_t &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{\theta \theta})_t &= \frac{u}{r} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \theta}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{zz})_t &= \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{rz})_t &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial r}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{r \theta})_t &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial v}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} - 
\frac{v}{r}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{\theta z})_t &= \frac{1}{2r} \frac{\partial w}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\label{eqn:
3dcyllageul}\\
\rho u_t &= \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \sigma_{r \theta}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{rr}}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\sigma_{rr} - \sigma_{\theta \theta}}{r} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{rz}}{\partial z}\notag\\
\rho v_t &= \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \sigma_{\theta \theta}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{r \theta}}
{\partial r} + \frac{2 \sigma_{r \theta}}{r} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{z \theta}}{\partial z}\notag \\
\rho w_t &= \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \sigma_{z \theta}}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{zz}}{\partial z} 
+ \frac{\partial \sigma_{rz}}{\partial r} + \frac{\sigma_{rz}}{r}.\notag
\end{align}

If we assume that $v = \epsilon_{\theta z} = \epsilon_{r \theta} = 0$ and there is no variation in the $\theta
$ direction, then the system (\ref{eqn:3dcyllageul}) simplifies to
\begin{align}
(\epsilon_{rr})_t &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{\theta \theta})_t &= \frac{u}{r} \notag\\
(\epsilon_{zz})_t &= \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\notag\\
(\epsilon_{rz})_t &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial r}\label{eqn:3daxisym}\\
\rho u_t &= \frac{\partial \sigma_{rr}}{\partial r} + \frac{\sigma_{rr} - \sigma_{\theta \theta}}{r} + \frac{\partial 
\sigma_{rz}}{\partial z}\notag\\
\rho w_t &= \frac{\partial \sigma_{zz}}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{rz}}{\partial r} + \frac{\sigma_{rz}}
{r}.\notag\\
\end{align}
It is interesting to note here that the strain in the $\theta \theta$ direction is non-zero and in this case is 
called the {\it hoop strain}.  A uniform radial displacement is not a rigid body motion, as it would be in the 
two-dimensional plane strain case, but instead produces a circumferential strain.  This is because the 
original circumference of the cylinder is $2\pi r$, but when there is a strain in the radial direction the 
circumference grows to $2\pi (r + u_r)$, inducing a strain $2\pi u_r / 2 \pi r = u_r/r$.  


The Jacobian for system (\ref{eqn:3daxisym}) in the z-direction is
\begin{equation}
f^{\prime}(q) = -\left(
\begin{array}{cccccc} 0&0&0&\frac{1}{\rho}&0&0 \\ 0&0&0&0&0&0 \\ 0&0&0&0&\frac{1}{2\rho}&0 \\ 
\sigma^{rr}_{\epsilon_{rr}}&\sigma^{rr}_{\epsilon_{zz}}&0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&
\sigma^{rz}_{\epsilon_{rz}}&0&0&0 \\ 0&0&0&0&0&0
\end{array}
\right), 
\end{equation}
and has an eigen-structure that is equivalent to the two-dimensional elasticity equations, with the 
addition of a second zero-speed eigenvalue.  

%The corresponding eigenvector is
%\begin{equation}
%r^6 = \left(
%\begin{array}{c} 0\\0\\1\\0\\0\\0
%\end{array}
%\right).
%\end{equation}

In this case, the equations for the source terms are
\begin{align}
(\epsilon_{\theta \theta})_t &= \frac{u}{r}  \notag\\
\rho u_t &= \frac{\sigma_{rr} - \sigma_{\theta \theta}}{r}\label{eqn:axisymeulsource}\\
\rho w_t &= \frac{\sigma_{rz}}{r}.\notag
\end{align} 
(Describe how this is incorporated into the numerical solution)

\subsection{Adaptive Mesh Refinement}
\label{sec:amr}
The pressure waveform found in ESWT contains a very thin region of high pressure that can not be 
resolved without a highly refined mesh.  In Figure \ref{fig:steepening} we investigated the effect of grid 
refinement on the shock wave profile and found that with grid resolution greater than $0.25$mm, the 
wave form at F2 was no longer a shock. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Effect of grid size on shock wave profile}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In order to efficiently calculate a reasonable ESWT waveform, we utilized ChomboClaw 
\cite{chomboclaw}, which uses the adaptive mesh refinement routines of CHOMBO with the wave 
propagation solvers of CLAWPACK.  This code can be run in parallel using MPI and we ran it on 
TeraGrid \cite{teragrid} system.  It has been indicated that Chombo will scale up to 10,000 processors 
\cite{collela_correspondance}.  We found that the ChomboClaw code scaled up to 128 processors, 
however we would like to do further testing on a larger system.

ellipsoidal geometry of the lithotripter.  (Re-running this job to save better plots/pressure waveform, need

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We have used this approach to model ESWT pressure waves interacting with three-dimensional bone 
geometries that we assume are comprised of idealized materials.  In some cases we model objects 
identical to those used in laboratory experiments \cite{amath_apl_nonunion}, but in others we extracted 
three-dimensional objects from CT scans of patient data \cite{fagnan_chang_ho}.  Here we present 
results that demonstrate the efficacy of the Lagrangian formulation, as well as examples of calculations 
performed using real three-dimensional geometries. 

\subsection{Heterotopic Ossification}
\label{sec:ho}
This experiment shows a calculation involving a heterotopic ossification, or a growth of bone-like 
material in soft tissue that is inhibiting the movement of the hip joint.  The composition and material 
properties of the ossification are not well understood.  We are able to use our model to investigate the 
effect of varying the material properties of the ossification as well as the strength of adhesion to the hip 
bone.  We found that the strength of the adhesion had a significant effect on the location of maximum 
stress in the object \cite{kfagnan_mchang_ho}.  Here we present a snapshot of the maximum shear and 
compressive stress calculated in the ossification.

(These will be a 3D embedded object, once I have figured out how to plot the stresses on the same 
figure and have the shading be different - I haven't yet determined how to do that)
